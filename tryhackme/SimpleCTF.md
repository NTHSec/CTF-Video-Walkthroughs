My second ever go at video documentation! The first one was super fun so I was happy to make another one. After reviewing my first video, here are some small changes that I made to improve the content:
- Increased terminal size for easier viewing
- Added time stamps & descriptions for those who only came for one section of the CTF (Enumeration, exploitation, privEsv, etc.)
- Added links to the description for the tools used
- Was generally more to the point and tried not to go down rabbit holes / start ranting
