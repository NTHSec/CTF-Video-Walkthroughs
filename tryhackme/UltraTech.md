This is the "UltraTech" box from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities?tab=practice), which was my first Medium box from THM! This box dove into the importance of proper enumeration, and had an awesome API vulnerability which allowed us to have code execution through the URL!

As always, all constructive criticism is welcome! Happy Hacking!
